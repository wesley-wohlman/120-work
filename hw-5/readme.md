[Basic Animation](https://wesley-wohlman.github.io/120-work/hw-5/)

Task is to create an animation with a moving or changing image. Can do either a creature, or abstract shapes. 

I had some trouble figuring out how to create each flower in one frame and settled on using a while loop and if statements. 
Your mouse position determines size of the flower.
