[Monster Portrait Sketch](https://wesley-wohlman.github.io/120-work/hw-4/)

The sketch was challenging to complete. I ran into issues with positioning and size. I draw by hand so constantly going back and forth between the browser and code threw me off. Commenting was very helpful, as was the push and pop functions. 

The portrait is of a griffin.
